__Esteamator__ is a tool that helps agile software teams with "planning poker".

It facilitates collecting estimates of effort for backlog items from team members to be averaged into consensus estimates.

It supresses the visibility of the estimates of other team members for each backlog item until estimates have been entered by all team members.
